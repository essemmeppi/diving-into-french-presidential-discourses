# Diving into French Presidential Discourses

## Introduction
The fragmentation of political opinions has formed a focal point of political analysis and concern for democratic debates. As is evident in the debate pre-empting the French Presidential election 2022: the encroachment towards parliaments and executives by extreme right-wing parties, and the new inflammatory nature of debates on climate change and migration, characterise political debate is in disarray, with no solid basis and common departing point. Whilst Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent president seeks to put forward a politics of moderate continuity, the right had mobilised around migratory waves, judging France to be on the brink of losing its integrity. The Left has contrastingly sought to redirect attention towards social issues, with limited success. Whilst polarisation must be taken seriously as a threat to democracy, subjects which appear non-controversial, remain highly political and potentially more constitutive of substantial debate. Using locally-trained word embedding models, trained on specific candidates’ twitter-discourses and their manifestos, we capture the politically determined particularities of these corpora that coalesce around shared tokens. We explicitly scrutinise ubiquitous and universal concepts as tokens imbued with meaning and reframed by candidates, by qualitatively analysing the word-vectors most proximate to these concepts in the corpora. Thus, we uncover what subtly, more genuinely, and potentially politically decisively differentiates candidates. Beyond classic topics such as the nation, the economy, and the digital, we analyse the underlying political assumptions that are palpable in what political candidates imply and appeal to in their campaigns. Indeed, they activate latent ontological assumptions, which are held ambivalently by the public.

## Background and Context

### The French Presidential Campaign
Since the 2017 French presidential elections, the France political landscape has undergone huge structural changes, disrupting the decades-old quasi two-party system (J. Evans & Ivaldi, 2017). This went hand in hand with a coalescence of parties around two main poles, on two dimensions. The first and dominating dimension sets an anti-immigration-authoritarian pole against a pro-immigration-liberal pole; the second pits an ecologist-interventionist pole against a productivist-neoliberal pole (Gougou & Persico, 2017). Since then the French political landscape has retained its polarity, whilst growing considerably more complex, therefore necessitating an open approach to its interpretation (König & Waldvogel, 2021). Nevertheless, immigration has retained its status as a central topic of the current, 2022, presidential campaign (partially shadowed by the war in Ukraine). However, it is paramount to reconsider topical salience, such as that of immigration, as rooted in generally shared sentiment and rationalities. Instead, such sentiments are often portrayed as inflated (Dennison & Geddes, 2019). Moreover, such securitization of discourse further stifles potential debate on certain issues pertinent to quotidian public life such as concerns on labour, participation in statehood, and democratic representation (Jendrissek, 2013; Mavelli, 2013). Indeed these run the not being debated in depth or adequately considered (Gattinara & Morales, 2017). A holistic understanding of the effects of fragmentation is of particular urgency as they have fed into concrete policy, with disproportionate and incoherent policy responses being formulated especially with regards to migration (Bove et al., 2021).

### Making Sense of Meaning
In order to come to terms with the ambiguity of meaning from a quantitative perspective, it first has to be formalised. Discourse is indeed indicative of normative political assumptions, resonant with fundamental political concerns: an ethics of statehood and citizenship. Its implied politics are future-oriented, value-laden, subject-shaping rationality (as inspired by Bear, 2014; Graeber, 2013; Hay, 2006; Jeffrey & Dyson, 2020). This is a politically inspired methodological and epistemological choice, which distances us from more realist and predictive approaches to politics (see for example Dahl, 1957; Gerring & Yesnowitz, 2006). As such, it also differs from more common epistemologies of data science. The measurement of meaning has been introduced to the numeric via sociology. Sociologists formalised the interpretive approaches of anthropology (Geertz, 1966; Mohr, 1998). Culture thereby remained an open system that was invariably linked to practice or real-life experiences (Mohr, 2000). Cognitive anthropology has further enhanced this approach, highlighting the importance of ambiguous meaning in semi-propositional beliefs. These are notions assumed to be known, whilst in actuality being continuously interpreted (for example that of “the economy”) (Sperber, 1982). American Sociology has since made use of computational methods to analyse large corpora of text and discover otherwise unnoticed patterns (J. A. Evans & Aceves, 2016). This approach remains contentious as it considers text to be culturally exhaustive and all telling, instead of considering “language to be more than words” (Smith, 2020) thus approaching a pre-theorized or undertheorized sociality. In other words, the appeal to grasp meaning is lost and beyond associating cultural categories or pre-conceptualised patterns of communication, as has been pointed out by Lenci (2018) from a linguistic perspective. Retaining the openness, nuance of meaning, as well as that of politics, will remain a central concern for us in order to fully grasp the political relevance, and breadth of debate that coalesces around neutral seeming words. 

### Secrets of Data Science
Data science does offer certain possibilities through which to capture meaning in its pertinent ambiguity. As Smith (2020) outlines, considering words as distributional vectors refines the meanings of words as based on context. These can produce “intuitive results […] useful for the cultural analyst” when emerging from a specific embedding space(Stoltz and Taylor, 2021: 4). Indeed, word-embeddings have already been widely used to uncover latent ideological difference in political language (Bonikowski et al., 2021; Rheault & Cochrane, 2020) or uncover shifting cultural meanings of categories such as class and race (Kozlowski et al., 2019). Milbauer et al (2021) similarly scrutinise the latent polarisation in Reddit groups by aligning the corpora of different subreddits.  They render inconsistencies in the corpora’s structure visible (as misalignments), and thereby the latent area of polarisation and the “cultural value” that this betrays. Here, wariness must be retained as generative models of language do not necessarily represent the functioning of natural language (Khalife et al., 2021) nor the inherent unpredictability of politics (Hay, 2006). As such, there is an epistemological limitation regarding the extent to which findings can be considered an encapsulation of meaning, which is intelligible with a broader “culture”. This pertains to broader unclarities regarding the limits and potentials of “interpretability” in the discipline of data science (Desai et al., 2022). Findings of social nature are often falsely related to realist epistemologies (Boyd & Crawford, 2012) despite algorithms’ deployment as technical objects, rather than epistemic objects subject to proofs (Lowrie, 2017). Retaining the meaning as embedded within distributional vectors, as well as understanding it as indicative of a broader, complex, inherently social phenomena, must remain central to the accuracy of our deployment of theory and interpretation of our results.

### Motivation of the Research Question
Can one use locally-trained word embeddings to study the different meanings that shared words take for different political actors? Can this analysis provide an insight into the hidden ontological assumptions that sustain political actors' discourses? Our research question, probing towards the different meanings attributed to “imbue-able” and mobilizable concepts depending on political inclination in the French presidential campaign of 2022, emerges both as a politically relevant question in content, methodology, and interpretation of the result. Our motivation is broadly two-pronged. The political urgency to highlight areas of debate in a fragmented campaign, which pertain to substantial, structural political debates and not to the custom face-value click-bait content, is central to understanding the hidden depth of a debate. Moreover, the methodology and interpretation demanded by the political nature of this project, necessitate the ability to encapsulate and hold the indeterminacy of social and especially political phenomena. Thus, the epistemological choices that pertain to the research question inquire into the possibility for the rich epistemology of data science to resonate with the indeterminacy inherent to the epistemology of politics as it is held in social theory. Our research question is thereby  grounded firstly, in an examination of the data science tools of word embeddings as a means of encapsulating political meaning and, secondly, in a scrutiny of the salience of twitter-feeds and manifestos in serving as a corpus through which to train the required “politically meaningful” word embeddings. In our interpretation of the results we expand upon the possibility to relate these findings back to the landscape of the French presidential campaign of 2022, and political discourse more generally. As such this research question and project mark an explicit intervention against “theory-free” data science which has permeated computational sociology and risks imposing regularities, which turn associations into definitive meanings.

## Data and Methods
Twitter served as the primary source of data for this project in being one of the main platforms for contemporary and immediate political debate within the context of the French presidential election 2022. Here, candidates and their affiliates conduct their respective presidential campaigns within the infrastructural possibilities that Twitter offers (280 character long tweets which contain certain responses or impulses to general discourse on the campaign). Twitter lends itself particularly well to this kind of analysis, as it is considered to be a serious and acceptable opinion-sharing platform of semi-official status, in which brief and strongly opinionated comments are accepted, sought out, and taken as a point of reference by the public. Thus, Twitter is generally considered to be a serious intervention in political discourse when used by politicians. Its brevity also induces an emotionally laden usage, (Duncombe, 2019), which can be exploited to extract (political) moral codes (Solomon, 1978). Its immediacy allows us to genuinely capture the political moment (McCormick et al., 2017).   

We create a corpus per candidate which is indicative of their political positioning during the campaign by aggregating their tweets and those of their affiliates as elements of a list. To this, we add the manifestos of the separate candidates, each sentence representing an element of this list. Based on these corpora, we train locally-trained word embeddings, thus analysing the idiosyncrasies across candidates, tapping into their locally attributed meaning (Stoltz & Taylor, 2021: 4). As such our analysis has been conducted on a relatively small corpus, however, its results thereby retain the possibility to be qualitatively interpreted (Dénigot & Burnett, 2021).  

Given the seven list of tweets and of sentences, we use gensim to train the model (Rehurek & Sojka, 2011) and spaCy to help clean the corpus (Honnibal & Montani, 2017). Then we find the most common words in the list of each candidate. After having analysed and selected the key shared words we want to work with, we divide them in five main categories. These categories, and the words we considered in our analysis are:  
- Nation: ‘france’, ‘etat’, ‘souverainete’, ‘president’, ‘politique’, ‘droit’
- Economy: ‘entreprise’, ‘economie’ ‘emploi’, ‘travail’, ‘taxes’
- Digital: ‘numerique’, ‘donnees’, ‘data’
- Hidden ontologies: ‘monde’, ‘realite’, ‘verite’, ‘societe’, ‘pouvoir’, ‘avenir’, ‘histoire’
- Extra: ‘contre’, ‘faut’, ‘crise’ 

These 5 main categories all demonstrate a diverse kind of  analytical purchase, thus relating to different areas and depths of statehood, betraying mutually illuminating more fundamental political norms. The chosen tokens, by not being explicitly politicised in common parlance and lent themselves well to uncovering latent ideology. In the following, we outline this approach.  

**Nation**: This category is an attempt at answering following questions, when interpreting proximate word vectors against broader discourse. Where are the boundaries of the nation drawn and defined through delimiting a national body (Anderson, 1991), identifying and excluding threats (Asad, 2003), and projecting the nation into the future or the past (Mitchell, 2007)? For example, defining the nation as a body based on shared inheritance, carried into the future by children, could be indicative of paternal, conservative politics, premised on the notion of national puitry (Devan, 1997). Here, the specific words, emphasise different aspects of statehood: “france” evoking more cultural associations, whereas “etat” evoked more governmental concepts.  
**Economy**: Similarly, approaching the economy from substantivist point of view (Polanyi, 1944; Çalişkan & Callon, 2009) allows us to read it as system of value, displaying who is considered to be productive, integral to the production of value and salience of the nation and who is deserving of retribution (Bear, 2015; Graeber, 2006). Considering the centrality of the economy in contemporary society (Appel, 2017; Michell, 2007), this betrays which entities are most valued in the national-body.  
**Digital**: In addressing the digital, we focus on a new site of concern where the stakes for political inclinations have not yet been sedimented. However, the present and future threats and possibilities that the digital poses, are of concern to the public (treatment of data and the power of the GAFAM) (Peitsch, 2013; Zuboff, 2019). Privacy, ownership, and sovereignty in the face of transnational private firms (Floridi, 2020), but also innovation and novelty (Irani, 2015) are differently weighted issues, which candidates make a political choice to tap into or not.  
**Hidden Ontologies**: In an exploratory fashion we realised that tokens, which referenced a certain generality (monde, realite), were proximate to word embeddings, which were evocative of that word view. Whilst this is evidently due to expressions such as ”tout le monde'' and “en réalité,” their etymological origins seem to be preserved enough to render results interpretable.   
**Extra**: In the same exploratory fashion, words that required positionality or action similarly betrayed those positions. However this approach remains exploratory and is not grounded in broader social science theory.
