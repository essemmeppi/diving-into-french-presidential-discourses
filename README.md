# Diving into French Presidential Discourses
Research project for the course [Diving in the Digital Public Space](https://syllabus.sciencespo.fr/cours/202120/195617.html) (Sciences Po, CEU) by Giulia Annaliese Paxton, Ryan Hachem, and Simone Maria Parazzoli. The course was taught in 2021-2022 spring semester by [Jean-Philippe Cointet](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/equipe/jean-philippe-cointet/) (médialab, Sciences Po) and [Márton Karsai](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/people/marton-karsai) (Department of Network and Data Science, Central European University), with the assistance of [Armin Pournaki](https://pournaki.com) and [Ludovico Napoli](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/people/ludovico-napoli).

## Abstract
The following study aims to elicit the difference in meaning attributed to key words in political discourse, which have the potential to betray latent politics of the candidates in question. The discourses of 7 candidates for the French presidential election of 2022 are analysed by comparing the variable word-embedding models trained on each candidates’ corpora. The corpora are made of the Twitter activity of candidates, the Twitter activity of around 15 affiliates for each candidate, and each candidate’s campaign manifesto. We qualitatively compare the word vectors of key shared words, analysing the most similar words to them in the variable word-embedding spaces to find different political inclinations. We conclude that the difference in political meaning of key concepts is palpable, yet that our method must be paired with a strong qualitative-interpretive approach in order to be analytically and socially relevant.

- **[code.py](https://github.com/essemmeppi/diving-into-french-presidential-discourses/blob/bbd5860eeb31466251b0fc7ee606bc730a99c30e/code.py)** - the Python code that allows interested readers to replicate our research. The code is divided in seven main parts that constitute the sections in which we train the seven models used in our work
- **[models](https://github.com/essemmeppi/diving-into-french-presidential-discourses/tree/main/models)** - the folder with the 7 notebooks we wrote to generate the word embeddings models of each of the 7 candidate (look at [Emmanuel Macron's notebook](https://github.com/essemmeppi/diving-into-french-presidential-discourses/blob/c591c2fd4865efabdd635e6c4265b972c43ac9b2/models/model_em.ipynb) for a rich explanation of the script, those of the other candidates are a replication with with very slight differences)
